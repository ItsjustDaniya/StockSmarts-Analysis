#  StockSmarts – Risk-Adjusted Stock Performance Analysis

A data analysis project focused on evaluating stock performance using
risk-adjusted metrics rather than price growth alone.

##  Problem
Traditional stock evaluation relies heavily on price appreciation,
often ignoring volatility and downside risk.

##  Objective
To analyze historical stock data and identify stable, high-quality
performers using returns, volatility, and trend consistency.

##  Approach
- Excel-based analysis using pivot tables and KPI dashboards
- Risk vs Return and volatility trend analysis
- Consulting-style storytelling through executive presentation

##  Key Insights
- High returns do not always imply low risk
- A small subset of stocks contributes disproportionately to volatility
- Stable stocks deliver better risk-adjusted performance

##  Recommendations
- Prioritize risk-adjusted metrics for portfolio construction
- Flag highly volatile stocks early using trend analysis
- Balance portfolios with stable performers
